## Refactor

**Notes:**

We were tasked to view the code for this site and modify it just enough to make it look and run smoother while keeping most of the source code intact. 

For this project I reworked some of the Horiseon code in order for the site to look similar. However I made a few changes to the html and css components for them to be easier to read by other programmers. 

***HTML***

For most of the div tags I renamed them to programmers or anyone looking to navigate the page could do so with a friendlier layout. A header tag was added to specify the top of the page. Inside said hear I added the nav tag to the links for each of the sections below. I added the image of the meeting to the hero section in order to make edits to the image. For the descriptive sections I changed the tags to articles.

Towards the bottom of the page a section was added to split up the aside tags that were changed. To finish the page I ended with a footer to finish off the HTML changes.

***CSS***

The css syntax was rearranged and changed to better follow the structure that the html layout had. One of the biggest sections was moving the search engine optimization, online reputation management, and social media marketing up just below the "p" and h3" tags.

To make the site more reader friendly the color was changed to the "color: #eee". This helps make it easier on the eyes.
