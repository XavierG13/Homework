# Homework

We were tasked to view the code for this site and modify it just enough to make it look and run smoother while keeping most of the source code intact. 

For this project I reworked some of the Horiseon code in order for the site to look similar. However I made a few changes to the html and css components for them to be easier to read by other programmers. 

I went ahead and change a few div tags to section, header, article and footer. I did this for navigation purposes to find content easier.

I modified css and changed the image heights and widths, the color of the font to be easier on the eyes, and shifted some of the content up the page. The jpeg was removed from the css and added to the html as an image source.
